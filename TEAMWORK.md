# Teamwork

## Division of Labour
**Explained below in detail, _or skip it all and see Table 1 (below) for a breakdown of who-did-what-by-task_** ‚ùó

The work for this milestone (#1) of this project will be divided as follows, broken down by Exercise:

- **Exercise 1: Getting Setup:** 
Xin (Max) will create the GitHub repository and add in all members as collaborators. (Zeefan, Catherine, and Sidney - remaining members, will approve the resultant collaboration request.) 

- **Exercise 2: Markdown Formatting:**
Sidney and Catherine will each include multiple markdown features of GitHub on the TEAMWORK.md file. Xin and Zeefan will do the same for the README.md file. 
Sidney will check, after all files have been uploaded that at least 5 unique markdown features are included across the two *.md files in accordance with the assignment.

- **Exercise 3: Merge one pull request per teammate:**
To ensure assignment completion, each teammate will create a pull request on the file INTRODUCTION.md in our main brainch. - the edits made in the pulls are simple comment lines. We will coordinate at least one simple unique pull request and approval per teammate synchronously, during a Google Meet call. 
Beyond this basic completion of the exercise, pull requests will be created and approved ad-hoc (as in as needed, by whoever is available for review at the time) on the troubleshooting.Rmd, REEADME.md, and TEAMWORK.md file as the team finalizes edits. Since I can't tell you now who has made and approved what pull request to be graded we will indicate this in the names of the pull request. **Titles of pull requests we are submitting for grading will read something like: "GRADED_SubbmittedbyTeamMember_ApprovedbyTeamMember", for clairity. **

- **Exercise 4: Github Issues:**
The 4 of us will independently create our issue introducing ourselves and comment on everyone else's.

- **Exercise 5: Teamwork Contract:**
This was a collaborative effort. All 4 teammates discussed the points to be included synchronously on Google Meet. Zeefan sent a skeleton draft, Catherine uploaded a revision, which I (Sidney) have pulled to be finalized. 

- **Exercise 6: Troubleshooting document:**
Xin (Max) will lead the fixes required. The rest of us will review his edits when he is done. 

- **Exercise 7: README file:**
Zeefan is going to provide a skeleton/ draft of this file (unclear if this will be on or off repo), which I (Sidney) will edit and submit for approval by the others.

- **Exercise 8: Submitting this Milestone:**
Xin(Max)(Github maestro) is in charge of this.

## Timing / Meeting schedule
- Google Meet on Tuesdays (starting 09-19) at 8:00 pm. (Prior to the first meeting each team member should have read over Milestone 1. Afterwords team members should begin independant work).
- In-person meet after Sept 21st class (at Koerner library, with the aim to complete the remaining exercises).
- In person meets will be scheduled as needed therafter.
- _see also column 5 in table 1 for exercise completion targets / dates_

## Communication 
- All team members should attend synchronous meetings (09-19 and 09-21)
- Asynchronous communication through **Slack** in group chat (text).
- Teammates are expected to respond to messages on Slack within 24 hours. However, when the deadline of a Milestone draws closer, teammates should reply to messages as promptly as possibly.
