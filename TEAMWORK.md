# Teamwork

## Division of Labour (Sidney)

## Timing (Catherine)
We plan to meet over Google Meetings on Sept 19th at 8:00 pm. Prior to this meeting each team member should read over Milestone 1. We will then work individually on our assigned tasks before class on Sept 21st. Our "pull-request practice" and self-introduction in issues should already be completed at this time. After class we will meet in person, where Sidney and Cathy will check and merge the changes on _"TEAMWORK.md"_ that were made to the main branch. As they will be working on different sub-parts of the document, pull requests will be made in turn. Max and Zefan will then use the same procedure to make pull requests on _"README.md."_ During this in person meeting we will make a pull-request to merge the troubleshooting task. Pull-requests should be reviewed by all team members to ensure that our work is of high quality.

## Communication (Catherine)
Our group plans to communicate mostly through **Slack** by texting. This will involve planning out in person or online meetings where we discuss upcoming assignments or any issues we have with current assignments. Teammates are expected to respond to messages on Slack within 24 hours. However, when the deadline of a Milestone draws closer, teammates should reply to messages as promptly as possibly. Online meetings will be hosted over Google Meetings every Tuesday at 8:00 pm. In person meetings will take place at Koerner library after class and will be organized when necessary.
