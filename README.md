## **What is this project?**

This repository was created by UBC graduate students as part of a course assignment for STAT 545A (Exploratory Data Analysis). The primary objective of the assignment is to familiarize graduate students (us - Xin (Max), Zefan, Catherine, and Sidney - Hi!ðŸ¤—) with GitHub functionalities (such as pull requests, Github issues, _this README file_ ðŸ˜‰, etc.) as such, **readers will find the following documents** / our learning tools **in the main directory:**

1. _TEAMWORK.md_ 
This is a markdown file that serves as a "contract" for our group members to keep us accountable for completing our own work. It largely describes how we divided up the tasks that needed to be completed for the earliest parts (those required for 'milestone #1') of this project, when we aimed to complete everything, and how often we aim to communicate with each other. There is also no code to be run in this file. 

2. _Troubleshooting-1.Rmd_ 
This is an **R** markdown file. It actually has some code. Herein readers will find erroneous R code that us graduate students have been assigned to fix, as well as our fixes ðŸ’… for the faulty code. You can download this .Rmd file and open it in RStudio on your local device, or copy the text and paste it into an open/new R markdown file on your local device to run it.

    2.1 _Troubleshooting-1.md_ Is the 'knitted' version of this document. It contains not only all of the code in the *.Rmd version, but also the output yeilded by RStudio when the code is run.

3. _Troubleshooting-2.Rmd_ 
This is another **R** markdown file (with code). This file contains additional (and somewhat more complex) erroneous R code that we (graduate students) were assigned to fix, plus our (majorly Max's this time - thanks Max!) fixes ðŸ’… for the faulty code. Just like the Troubleshooting-1* file, You can download this .Rmd file and open it in RStudio on your local device, or copy the text and paste it into an open/new R markdown file on your local device to run it. (For both troubleshooting documents, our fixes for the erroneous code are generally explained in comments / non-code lines preceeded by a hashtag.)

    3.1 _Troubleshooting-2_knitted.md_ Is the 'knitted' version of 'Troubleshooting-2.Rmd', containing both R code and output.

_Other notes:_ Should experienced Github readers notice seemingly redundant use of GitHub functionality (like a weird pull request), please be forgiving (some of us are new here).
