# README file for project introduction & files introduction

This is the README file for the first milestone project. In this project we introduced ourselves in “Issues”, built and signed the group contract for group collaboration, solved pre-designed troubleshooting problems and also got familiar with the R functionalities, during the process of which we learned Github operations, especially “pull requests”.  This README.md file is a Markdown file that basically introduces all the exercises that we did for this project, and the TEAMWORK.md is another Markdown file where we set up our division of labour, timing and also communication method. As for troubleshooting.md, this is where we solved three pre-designed errors. Note that before we started to do the exercises above, we first got ourselves familiar with pull-request by introducing ourselves in a file called INTRODUCTION.md, where we did a one-line self-introduction and a two-truth-one-lie game.
