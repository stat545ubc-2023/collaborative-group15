## **What is this project?**

This repository was created by UBC graduate students as part of a course assignment for STAT545A (exploratory data analysis). The primary objective of the assignment is to familiarize graduate students (us - Xin (Max), Zefan, Catherine, and Sidney - Hi!ðŸ¤—) with GitHub functionalities (such as pull requests, Github issues, _this README file_ ðŸ˜‰, etc.) as such, **readers will find the following documents** / our learning tools **in the main directory:**

1. _INTRODUCTION.md_
A silly file made of one-line comments the team made to each other, partly to introduce ourselves, and partly to practice making and approving pull requests to one another - there is no code to be run in this document - you can ignore it unless you'd like to read our ðŸ’¬

2. _TEAMWORK.md_ 
This is a markdown file that serves as a "contract" for our group members to keep us accountable for completing our own work. It describes how we divided up the tasks that needed to be completed for the earliest parts ('milestone #1') this project, when we aimed to complete everything, and how often we aim to communicate with each other. There is also no code to be run in this file. 

3. _Troubleshooting-1.Rmd_ 
This is an **R** markdown file. It actually has some code. Herein readers will find erroneous R code that us graduate students have been assigned to fix, as well as our fixes ðŸ’… for the faulty code. You can download this .Rmd file and open it in Studio on your local device, or copy the text and paste it into an open/new R markdown file on your local device to run it. 

4. _Troubleshooting-2.Rmd_ 
This is another **R** markdown file (with code). This file contains additional (and somewhat more complex) erroneous R code that we (graduate students) were assigned to fix, plus our (majorly Max's this time - thanks Max!) fixes ðŸ’… for the faulty code. Just like the Troubleshooting-1* file, You can download this .Rmd file and open it in RStudio on your local device, or copy the text and paste it into an open/new R markdown file on your local device to run it. (For both troubleshooting documents, our fixes for the erroneous code are generally explained in comments / non-code lines that are preceeded by a hashtag.)

_Other notes:_ Should experienced Github readers notice seemingly redundant use of GitHub functionality (like a weird pull request), please be forgiving (some of us are new here).
